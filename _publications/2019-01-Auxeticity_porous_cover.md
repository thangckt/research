abstract: "The search for new auxetic mechanisms and more auxetic materials are two important research directions in the study of auxeticity. It is well known that instabilities are usually regarded as deleterious phenomena and thus their prevention is needed. However, the work of Sung Youb Kim and his research group (article no. 1800122) shows that some elastic instabilities act as mechanisms for auxeticity in several metals and periodic metallic porous structures. The upper part of the cover figure shows that the Bornâ€“Hill's elastic instability, i.e., an elastic material instability, causes a phase transformation leading to auxeticity in a facecentered cubic metal. The lower part of the figure describes another elastic instability, i.e., buckling of the microstructure of a periodic metallic porous structure, that induces a pattern transformation causing auxeticity in the structure. Details of relevant numerical results can be found in the article."
