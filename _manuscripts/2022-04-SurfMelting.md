abstract: "We present a study of the melting of the EAM aluminum surfaces by means of molecular dynamics simulations. At a temperature above the thermodynamic equilibrium, melting initiates at the free surface and spreads in a complicated manner depending on surface orientation. We figure out two different mechanisms governing the melting spreading, i.e., the self-growing of the liquid nuclei and the coalescence of neighboring liquid nuclei. Our simulation results demonstrate a dominance of the coalescence mechanism on the Al(110) surface resulting in the flat melting front, whereas the shape of melting front on the Al(111) surface is spherical-like due to the weakness of coalescence mechanism. Overall, this study provides a more fundamental understanding of the onset of melting of the crystalline surfaces."
