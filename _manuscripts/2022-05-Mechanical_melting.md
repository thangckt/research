abstract: "Mechanical melting and thermodynamic melting are recognized by now as two distinct scenarios of melting. In this report, we employ an enhanced sampling approach, i.e., the parallel dynamic scheme of the logarithmic mean-force dynamics method, to investigate the melting process of bulk aluminum. We compute the free energy profile for the melting process and simultaneously estimate both values of mechanical melting and thermodynamic melting of aluminum. Besides several advantages over the currently available methods, our result shows that the value of thermodynamic melting predicted by this approach has a very minor dependence on system size while giving a comparable accuracy. Meanwhile, the predicted mechanical melting is in good agreement with the Born criterion of elastic stability. Our result also confirms the previous finding of the role of volume in melting transition and that thermoelastic instability occurs when the specific volume of the solid phase reaches a critical value, but figure that this critical volume is not so close to that of the liquid phase."
